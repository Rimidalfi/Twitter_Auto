# Twitter Direkt Message Automation

The first idea for this project sparked as I realized that the twitter API is very limited in its free model. You can tweet and not much more. 
So I made the decision to write my own application to send new followers a welcome message and maybe more...

Since Twitter API is basically useless as stated before I needed to find another solution!

So here is the basic plan: 

+ get the current follower state
+ check for new followers in a given timeframe
+ contact followers in a given timeframe
